#Ruby project boilerplate

This is a Ruby boilerplate that comes with RSpec and automated test functionality setup(uses Guard)

I'm a fan of test driven development, in order to speed up my turnaround time from writing functionality to testing the functionality, I use Guard(https://github.com/guard/guard) tool to automatically run my test any time I make a change.

This greatly speeds up my development time and hopefully it'll help you too.

##Quick start

Clone the git repo 'https://github.com/cnak/ruby_boilerplate.git'

##Instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. Run 'bundle exec install'
3. Run 'guard' command in the terminal to start watching changes
4. Place your spec files within the spec folder and any functionality code with the 'lib' folder
